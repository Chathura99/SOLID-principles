## SOLID Principles
This repository contains examples and explanations of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

### Introduction
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that are intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Each of these principles focuses on a different aspect of object-oriented design, and when applied together, they can help developers create more robust and scalable software systems.

### Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility or job. This principle helps to keep classes focused and makes them easier to understand, test, and maintain.

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the behavior of a system without modifying its existing code. This principle encourages the use of abstraction and polymorphism to achieve flexibility and maintainability.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without altering the desirable properties of the program. This principle ensures that inheritance is used correctly and that polymorphism behaves as expected.

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that large interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them. This principle helps to prevent interface pollution and reduces the coupling between components.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes loose coupling between modules and allows for easier substitution of dependencies.
